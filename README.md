# PetroleumPricePrediction

This project aims to create a time series model capable of predicting the price value of Petroleum, specifically the price per barrel of Brent crude oil. Produced in the North Sea (Europe), Brent is a class of crude oil that serves as a benchmark for the international price of different types of oil.

The data used for this project is available at the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/).
